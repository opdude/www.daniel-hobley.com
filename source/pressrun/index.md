Pressrun is a platform which allows magazine companies to create their own interactive magazines without having to know how to program. Pictures, music and videos are easily embeded into the interactive magazines with the use of templates created by Abobe In-Design. 

And for those who want customised interactive elements the full power of HTML5 and Javascript is available with very little extra work. Pressrun also includes its own portal where the exported magazines can be uploaded and then converted automagically into formats that bespoke iOS and Android applications can understand.
