*OpiConsole* is a DrawableGameComponent that gives users a quick setup console for any XNA based applications, it provides users with the ability to add custom commands and cvars, with the added ability of being able to modify the look and feel of the console. The console was built for a number of my own XNA projects but I decided that it could be easily packaged up and released for others to use and modify as they wished.

More information about OpiConsole can be found at its [codeplex](http://opiconsole.codeplex.com/) project page.
